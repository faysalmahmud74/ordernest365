## 📌 Project Overview

Order Nest was developed to solve common operational challenges faced by small businesses in local markets – such as manual stock updates, untracked purchases, and scattered reports. With a clean dashboard and real-time updates, it helps business owners maintain full control over their inventory and finances with zero complexity.

A few early-stage businesses in my hometown are already using Order Nest actively in their daily operations, and the feedback has been very positive in terms of usability and reliability.
